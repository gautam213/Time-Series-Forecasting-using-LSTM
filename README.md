Recurrent neural networks like the Long Short-Term Memory network or LSTM add the explicit handling of order between observations when learning a mapping function from inputs to outputs, not offered by MLPs or CNNs(Convulational Neural Networks). They are a type of neural network that adds native support for input data comprised of sequences of observations.
